## Overview

<p>This project is of a Magic 8-Ball for those questioning what their future will hold. Curious Janes and Joes can play this game by asking themselves a question and clicking the 8-ball, giving the 8-ball a little shake (possible with the use of the add event listener method, and CSS animation), and waiting for their response.</p>

<p><b>Tech used:</b> HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
